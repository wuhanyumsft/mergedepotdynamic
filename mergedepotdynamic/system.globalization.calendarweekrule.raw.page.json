The <a class=\"xref\" href=\"system.globalization.datetimeformatinfo#System_Globalization_DateTimeFormatInfo_FirstDayOfWeek_\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">FirstDayOfWeek</a> property provides the default value for a culture, but any <a class=\"xref\" href=\"system.dayofweek\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">DayOfWeek</a> value can be specified as the first day of the week in the <a class=\"xref\" href=\"system.globalization.calendar#System_Globalization_Calendar_GetWeekOfYear_\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">GetWeekOfYear</a> method.  </p>\n<p> The first week based on the FirstDay value can have one to seven days.

Selecting FirstFullWeek defines the first Sunday (January 6) as the beginning of the first week of the year. The first five days of the year are considered part of the last week of the previous year. In contrast, selecting FirstFourDayWeek defines the first day of the year (January 1) as the beginning of the first week of the year because there are more than four days from January 1 to the day before the following Sunday.  </p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>FirstDay</th>\n<th>FirstFullWeek</th>\n<th>FirstFourDayWeek</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Dec 31 Mon</td>\n<td>Last week of the previous year</td>\n<td>Last week of the previous year</td>\n<td>Last week of the previous year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 1 Tue</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Last week of the previous year</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 2 Wed</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Last week of the previous year</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 3 Thu</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Last week of the previous year</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 4 Fri</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Last week of the previous year</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 5 Sat</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Last week of the previous year</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 6 Sun</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 7 Mon</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 8 Tue</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 9 Wed</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 10 Thu</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 11 Fri</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan 12 Sat</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n<td>Week 1</td>\n<td>Week 2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> Suppose the first day of the year (January 1) falls on a Friday and the designated first day of the week is Sunday.

In the Gregorian calendar, the first day of the year (January 1) in 2013 falls on a Tuesday. If the designated first day of the week is Sunday, the first Sunday (January 6) is the first day of the first week of the year, and Saturday (January 5) belongs to the fifty-third week of the previous year. Changing the calendar week rule to FirstFourDayWeek defines Tuesday (January 1) as the beginning of the first week of the year, because there are more than four days between Tuesday, January 1, and Sunday, January 6. Using this rule, January 5 belongs to the first week of the year. For 2010, a year in which January 1 falls on a Friday, applying the FirstFourDayWeek rule with <a class=\"xref\" href=\"system.dayofweek\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">System.DayOfWeek</a> as the first day of the week makes Sunday, January 3 the beginning of the first week of the year, because the first week in 2010 that has more than four days is January 3 through 9.  </p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-vb\" name=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule#1\">Imports System.Globalization\n\nModule Example\n   \n   Dim cal As New GregorianCalendar()\n   \n   Public Sub Main()\n      Dim dat As Date = #01/05/2013#\n      Dim firstDay As DayOfWeek = DayOfWeek.Sunday\n      Dim rule As CalendarWeekRule\n      \n      rule = CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek\n      ShowWeekNumber(dat, rule, firstDay)\n      \n      rule = CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek\n      ShowWeekNumber(dat, rule, firstDay)\n\n      Console.WriteLine()\n      dat = #1/03/2010#\n      ShowWeekNumber(dat, rule, firstDay)\n   End Sub\n   \n   Private Sub ShowWeekNumber(dat As Date, rule As CalendarWeekRule, \n                              firstDay As DayOfWeek)\n      Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0:d} with {1:F} rule and {2:F} as first day of week: week {3}&quot;,\n                        dat, rule, firstDay, cal.GetWeekOfYear(dat, rule, firstDay))\n   End Sub   \nEnd Module\n&#39; The example displays the following output:\n&#39;       1/5/2013 with FirstFullWeek rule and Sunday as first day of week: week 53\n&#39;       1/5/2013 with FirstFourDayWeek rule and Sunday as first day of week: week 1\n&#39;       \n&#39;       1/3/2010 with FirstFourDayWeek rule and Sunday as first day of week: week 1\n</code></pre><pre><code class=\"lang-cs\" name=\"System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule#1\">using System;\nusing System.Globalization;\n\npublic class Example\n{\n   static Calendar cal = new GregorianCalendar();\n   \n   public static void Main()\n   {\n      DateTime date = new DateTime(2013, 1, 5);\n      DayOfWeek firstDay = DayOfWeek.Sunday;\n      CalendarWeekRule rule;\n      \n      rule = CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek;\n      ShowWeekNumber(date, rule, firstDay);\n      \n      rule = CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek;\n      ShowWeekNumber(date, rule, firstDay);\n      \n      Console.WriteLine();\n      date = new DateTime(2010, 1, 3);\n      ShowWeekNumber(date, rule, firstDay);\n   }\n\n   private static void ShowWeekNumber(DateTime dat, CalendarWeekRule rule, \n                                      DayOfWeek firstDay)\n   {                                   \n      Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0:d} with {1:F} rule and {2:F} as first day of week: week {3}&quot;,\n                        dat, rule, firstDay, cal.GetWeekOfYear(dat, rule, firstDay));\n   }   \n}\n// The example displays the following output:\n//       1/5/2013 with FirstFullWeek rule and Sunday as first day of week: week 53\n//       1/5/2013 with FirstFourDayWeek rule and Sunday as first day of week: week 1\n//       \n//       1/3/2010 with FirstFourDayWeek rule and Sunday as first day of week: week 1\n</code></pre><div class=\"NOTE\"><h5>Note</h5><p> This does not map exactly to ISO 8601.
